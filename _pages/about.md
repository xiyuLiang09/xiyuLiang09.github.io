Hi, I am a senior undergraduate student at the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/). I was previously a research assistant in the Spatio-Temporal Big Data and Intelligence Lab, where I conducted research on machine learning and spatio-temporal trajectory data mining under the supervision of Prof. [Shangshuo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=8qdXaOkAAAAJ) and Prof. [Lisi Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2YD5wcEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I am also a member of the [`ColAI`](https://github.com/Collaborative-AI), where I work closely with Dr. [Enmao Diao](https://diaoenmao.com/).

**Research Interests**
- Large Language Models
- Efficient and Trustworthy ML
- Spatio-Temporal data mining
