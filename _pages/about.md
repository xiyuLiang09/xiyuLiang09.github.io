I am a senior undergraduate student at the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/). I was previously a research assistant in the Spatio-Temporal Intelligence and Big Data Laboratory, where I conducted research on machine learning and spatio-temporal trajectory data mining under the supervision of Prof. [Shangshuo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=8qdXaOkAAAAJ) and Prof. [Lisi Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=8qdXaOkAAAAJ). I am also a member of the [ColAI](https://github.com/Collaborative-AI), where I work closely with Dr. [Enmao Diao](https://diaoenmao.com/) on the topic of large language models and efficient machine learning.
