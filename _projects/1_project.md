## **Project Overview**  
This system combines advanced deep learning and software engineering to monitor children at home and ensure their safety. By detecting hazardous activities like window climbing and analyzing postures in real time, the system helps prevent accidents before they happen.  

## **Key Features**  
- **Object and Pose Recognition**: Integrated YOLOv7 and PP-TinyPose to recognize dangerous postures accurately.  
- **Enhanced Detection Models**: Improved accuracy and reduced model loss with SE-Net integration.  
- **Lighting Adaptation**: Innovative automatic lighting detection and "electronic fence" technology ensure stability under varying light conditions.  
- **Full-Stack Software Development**: Designed for reliability and user-friendliness.  

## **Project Highlights**  
- Achieved **94/100** evaluation score (Rank **4/66**)  
- Led report writing, presentation, and implementation as the **Project Leader**  
- Real-time demo video showcasing hazard detection and recognition capabilities
